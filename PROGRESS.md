# 20. Retrieval Module Restructuring

The flat retrieval files (`retrieval.manager.ts`, `retrieval.types.ts`) were deleted and replaced with a proper directory structure:

```
ai/retrieval/
  types/
    retrieval.types.ts    — RetrievalChunk, RetrievalSource, RetrievalRoute
    citation.types.ts     — Citation
    context.types.ts      — RetrievalContext
  retrievers/
    retriever.interface.ts
    community.retriever.ts
    medical.retriever.ts
    retrieval.manager.ts  — orchestrates both retrievers
  ranking/
    result.ranker.ts
  context/
    contexBuilder.ts
  debug/
    retrieval.debug.ts
  utils/
    metadata.ts
```

---

# 21. Agent Graph — Bug Fixes & Consolidation

**File:** `src/ai/agents/query_support/graph.ts`

Fixed the broken method chain and consolidated three separate retrieval nodes (`retrieveCommunity`, `retrieveMedical`, `fanOutRetrieval`) into a single `retrieveContextNode`.

Final graph wiring:

```
START
↓
extractQuery
↓
decideIntent
↓ (conditional)
retrieveContext  ← community_only / medical_only / community_and_medical
generateAnswer   ← no_retrieval (direct)
↓
END
```

Also fixed a stray semicolon in `nodes.ts` that was breaking the `generateAnswerNode`.

---

# 22. `retrieveContextNode` — Full Retrieval Pipeline in One Node

**File:** `src/ai/agents/query_support/nodes.ts`

Implemented `retrieveContextNode` as the single retrieval entry point in the graph. It:

1. Reads `query` and `route` from state
2. Calls `RetrievalManager.retrieve(query, route)`
3. Passes results through `rankChunks()`
4. Builds structured context + citations via `buildContext()`
5. Calls `inspectRetrieval()` for debug logging
6. Returns `retrievedChunks`, `context`, `citations` to state

---

# 23. Context Builder — Conditional Sections

**File:** `src/ai/retrieval/context/contexBuilder.ts`

Built the context builder. Separates chunks by source, assigns sequential citation indices, and formats them into labeled sections. Empty sections are omitted — if only one source type returned results, only that section appears in the prompt.

Output format:

```
Medical Information:

[1] Source Title
chunk text

Community Information:

[2] Source Title
chunk text
```

Returns `{ context: string, citations: Citation[] }`.

---

# 24. Query API — `POST /query`

Wired the agent into the REST API.

**New files:**

```
src/api/dtos/query.dto.ts          — Zod schema: { message: string }
src/api/routes/query.route.ts      — registers POST /query
src/api/controllers/query.controller.ts
```

**Controller behavior:**

* Validates body with `QueryRequestDTO`
* Invokes `cancerSupportAgent.invoke({ messages: [HumanMessage] })`
* Returns `{ answer, citations, riskLevel, llmCalls }`

**`src/server.ts`** updated to register `/query` alongside `/posts` and `/health`.

Routes now available:

```
/health
/posts
/query
```

---

# 26. Auth System — JWT + User Model

Added full email/password authentication with JWT and ownership enforcement on post mutations.

**New files:**

```
src/domain/users.ts                    — User, CreateUserInput types
src/api/dtos/auth.dto.ts              — RegisterDTO, LoginDTO, AuthResponse
src/services/auth.service.ts          — registerUser (bcrypt, 12 rounds), verifyCredentials
src/api/controllers/auth.controller.ts — register → 201/409, login → 200/401
src/api/routes/auth.route.ts          — POST /auth/register, POST /auth/login
src/plugins/jwt.plugin.ts             — @fastify/jwt wrapped with fastify-plugin
src/api/middleware/authenticate.ts    — preHandler: jwtVerify → 401 on failure
src/types/fastify-jwt.d.ts            — JWT payload augmentation { sub, email }
```

**Schema changes (`prisma/schema.prisma`):**

* Added `User` model with `id`, `email`, `passwordHash`, `createdAt`
* Added `userId` (non-nullable FK) to `Post` with `@@index([userId])`
* Migration: `20260313165830_add_user_auth`

**Ownership enforcement:**

* `updatePost` and `deletePost` now fetch `userId` first, throw `FORBIDDEN` if mismatch
* Controller maps `FORBIDDEN` → 403, `POST_NOT_FOUND` → 404

**Route auth matrix:**

```
POST   /auth/register     — public
POST   /auth/login        — public
GET    /posts             — public
GET    /posts/:postId     — public
POST   /posts             — JWT required
PUT    /posts/:postId     — JWT + owner
DELETE /posts/:postId     — JWT + owner
POST   /query             — JWT required
```

---

# 27. Auth Integration Tests — `src/test.ts`

Added a self-contained test script covering the full auth loop using Node's built-in `assert/strict` and Fastify `inject()` (no test framework).

**Run:** `tsx src/test.ts` (requires Postgres; no Redis dependency — inline protected route avoids the posts service import chain)

9 tests:

```
✓ Register success                (201 + token + user.id)
✓ Register duplicate email        (409)
✓ Register duplicate username     (409)
✓ Register invalid input          (400)
✓ Login success                   (200 + token)
✓ Login wrong password            (401)
✓ Login unknown email             (401)
✓ Protected route — no token      (401)
✓ Protected route — valid token   (200)
```

Test user is deleted from the DB after every run.

---

# 28. Query Rewriting — `rewriteQueryNode` Wired Into Graph

**Files:** `src/ai/agents/query_support/graph.ts`, `nodes.ts`

`rewriteQueryNode` was already implemented but never connected. It is now inserted between `extractQuery` and `decideIntent`:

```
extractQuery → rewriteQuery → decideIntent → retrieveContext → generateAnswer
```

`retrieveContextNode` now uses `searchQuery ?? query` for Pinecone lookup — retrieval uses the LLM-optimised search terms while intent classification and answer generation still operate on the original user phrasing.

---

# 29. Citation Title Bug Fix

**Files:** `src/services/ingest.service.ts`, `src/workers/postIngest.worker.ts`

Post titles were embedded inside the ingestion text body but never stored as a separate Pinecone metadata field. At retrieval time `match.metadata?.title` was always `undefined`, causing `contexBuilder.ts` to default `Citation.title` to `""`.

**Fix:** Added `title?: string` to `IngestMetadata` and passed `title: post.title` in the `ingestText()` call. The `...metadata` spread in `ingest.service.ts` automatically writes it to every Pinecone record.

Existing vectors must be re-ingested (trigger an update on each post) to backfill the title metadata.

---

# 30. Reply Pipeline

Added full reply CRUD with async vector ingestion into the `community` Pinecone namespace alongside posts.

**Schema:** `Reply` model in `prisma/schema.prisma` — `id`, `postId` (FK → Post), `userId` (FK → User), `content`, `createdAt`. Index on `postId`.

**New files:**

```
src/domain/replies.ts                  — Reply type
src/api/dtos/replies.dto.ts            — CreateReplyDTO, ListRepliesQuery
src/services/replies.service.ts        — createReply, listReplies, deleteReply
src/api/controllers/replies.controller.ts
src/api/routes/replies.route.ts        — nested under /posts/:postId/replies
src/queues/replyIngest.queue.ts        — BullMQ queue (replyIngest)
src/workers/replyIngest.worker.ts      — create: embed + upsert; delete: filter-delete
```

Routes:

```
POST   /posts/:postId/replies          — JWT required
GET    /posts/:postId/replies          — public (paginated)
DELETE /posts/:postId/replies/:replyId — JWT + owner
```

Pinecone vectors for replies use metadata: `type: "reply"`, `replyId`, `postId`, `content`, `createdAt`. Stored in the `community` namespace.

---

# 31. RetrievalType — Separate Source from Content Type

Introduced `RetrievalType = "post" | "reply"` to decouple content-type from namespace origin.

**Changes:**

- `RetrievalSource` reverted to `"community" | "medical"` — replies are community content, not a separate source
- `RetrievalType` added to `retrieval.types.ts`; `type?: RetrievalType` field on `RetrievalChunk`
- `Citation.source` reverted to `"community" | "medical"`
- `CommunityRetriever` sets `source: "community"` always; `type: isReply ? "reply" : "post"` from Pinecone metadata
- Ranker split into `SOURCE_WEIGHT` (`medical: 1.1`, `community: 1.0`) and `TYPE_WEIGHT` (`post: 0.85`, `reply: 0.90`); type weight only applies to community chunks
- Context builder filter simplified to `chunk.source === "community"` — no `|| "reply"` hack needed

---

# 32. Thread Expansion Pipeline

When the retriever returns reply chunks, the agent now fetches the full thread context from Postgres and rebuilds the context with enriched thread blocks.

**New file:** `src/ai/retrieval/threads/threadFetcher.ts`

`fetchThreads(replyChunks)`:
1. Groups reply chunks by `parentPostId`, tracks matched `replyId`s
2. Sorts by match count desc, caps at 3 threads
3. Parallel Prisma fetch — post + up to 10 replies per thread
4. Returns `ThreadContext[]` with each reply flagged `isMatched: true/false`

**New types** in `retrieval.types.ts`: `ThreadReply`, `ThreadContext`

**New node** in `nodes.ts`: `expandThreadsNode`
- Filters `retrievedChunks` for reply chunks
- If any exist, calls `fetchThreads` then `buildContextWithThreads`
- Overwrites `context` and `citations` in agent state
- No-ops (returns `{}`) when no reply chunks are present

**Graph wiring** (`graph.ts`):
```
extractQuery → rewriteQuery → decideIntent → retrieveContext → expandThreads → generateAnswer
```

**`buildContextWithThreads`** in `contextBuilder.ts`:
- Keeps non-expanded post/reply chunks in regular `SOURCE [N]` blocks
- Adds `THREAD [N]` blocks showing full post content + all replies, with `** MATCHED **` markers on retrieved replies
- Reply chunks whose `parentPostId` was expanded are excluded from the regular section (no duplication)

---

# 33. Citation Metadata Enrichment — Reply Fields in API Response

Enriched the `Citation` type and both context-builder paths so reply-specific data surfaces in the `POST /query` response.

**`src/ai/retrieval/types/citation.types.ts`:**

```ts
type Citation = {
    index: number
    source: "community" | "medical"
    documentId: string
    title?: string
    type?: "post" | "reply"
    snippet?: string          // first 120 chars of chunk text
    parentPostId?: string     // only when type === "reply"
}
```

**`buildSection`** (both `buildContext` and `buildContextWithThreads`): populates `type`, `snippet`, and `parentPostId` for every chunk citation.

**Thread loop in `buildContextWithThreads`**: no longer emits a post-level citation with a nested `matchedReplies` array. Instead, each matched reply inside the thread becomes its own top-level citation (`type: "reply"`, `documentId: replyId`, `parentPostId`, `snippet`). The parent post is already covered by its own chunk citation from the regular section.

**`src/api/dtos/query.dto.ts`**: `QueryResponse.citations` widened to include `type`, `snippet`, `parentPostId`.

---

# 34. SSE Streaming — `POST /query`

**Files:** `src/api/controllers/query.controller.ts`, `src/api/dtos/query.dto.ts`, `src/ai/agents/query_support/nodes.ts`

Replaced the synchronous `cancerSupportAgent.invoke()` response with a full Server-Sent Events stream. The endpoint now hijacks the Fastify reply, sets `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, and streams JSON-encoded events as the agent progresses.

**Stream event types** (defined in `query.dto.ts`):

```ts
{ type: "status"; stage: string }          // pipeline stage progress
{ type: "token";  content: string }        // streamed answer token
{ type: "done";   citations; riskLevel; llmCalls }  // final metadata
{ type: "error";  message: string }        // agent failure
```

**Node-level changes (`nodes.ts`):**

All five nodes now accept `LangGraphRunnableConfig` as a second argument and call `config.writer?.()` to emit status events at the start of each stage:

```
rewriteQuery      → { event: "status", data: { stage: "rewriting" } }
decideIntent      → { event: "status", data: { stage: "deciding_intent" } }
retrieveContext   → { event: "status", data: { stage: "retrieving" } }
expandThreads     → { event: "status", data: { stage: "expanding_threads" } }
generateAnswer    → { event: "status", data: { stage: "generating" } }
```

`generateAnswerNode` switched from `llm.invoke()` to `llm.stream()`, emitting each token as `{ event: "answer_token", data: { token } }`.

**Controller** uses `cancerSupportAgent.stream()` with `streamMode: ["custom", "values"]` — `"custom"` chunks carry node events; `"values"` chunks capture the latest full state. Final `done` event is assembled from `lastState` after the loop.

---

# 35. Error Resilience — try/catch Throughout

All previously unguarded async operations now have explicit error handling with sensible fallbacks so a single failure doesn't crash the request.

| Location | Failure | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| `rewriteQueryNode` | LLM call | use original `query` as `searchQuery` |
| `decideIntentAndRetrievalNode` | LLM/parse | `route: "both"`, `riskLevel: "low"` |
| `generateAnswerNode` | LLM stream | static sorry message |
| `expandThreadsNode` | DB fetch | return `{}` (no-op) |
| `RetrievalManager.retrieve()` | retriever | return `[]` per source |
| `fetchThreads` | per-thread Prisma | `null` (filtered out) |
| `ingest.service.ts` | split / embed / upsert | distinct error message thrown |
| `ingest.service.ts` (delete) | post/reply filter-delete | distinct error message thrown |

`contextBuilder.ts`: type field now spread conditionally (`...(chunk.type !== undefined && { type: chunk.type })`) to satisfy `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.

---

# 25. Posts API — Read Endpoints

**Files modified:**

```
src/services/posts.service.ts
src/api/controllers/posts.controller.ts
src/api/routes/posts.route.ts
```

Added:

### `listPosts(page, limit)`

* Fetches paginated posts ordered by `createdAt` desc
* Returns `{ posts, total }`

### `getPost(postId)`

* Fetches single post by ID
* Returns `null` if not found (controller returns 404)

Routes:

```
GET /posts            — paginated list (query params: page, limit)
GET /posts/:postId    — single post by ID
```

---

# 36. Monorepo Restructure

Repository reorganized into a pnpm monorepo:

```
hac-monorepo/
├── server/          # Fastify API + BullMQ workers (src moved here)
├── web/             # Next.js 15 frontend (App Router)
├── packages/
│   └── shared/      # @hac/shared — shared types + ApiClient
├── pnpm-workspace.yaml
└── package.json     # workspace root with concurrently dev script
```

- Root `package.json` runs `pnpm dev` via `concurrently` to start server + web in parallel
- `packages/shared/src/api.ts` — shared TypeScript types (`PostResponse`, `ReplyResponse`, `PaginatedResponse`, etc.)
- `packages/shared/src/lib/api.ts` — `ApiClient` class wrapping all Fastify endpoints

---

# 37. CORS + FRONTEND_URL

- `server/src/config/env.ts`: added `FRONTEND_URL` (optional, default `http://localhost:3000`)
- `server/src/server.ts`: registered `@fastify/cors` with `origin: env.FRONTEND_URL, credentials: true`
- `server/.env.example`: updated to include `FRONTEND_URL`

---

# 38. server.ts Async Refactor

`buildServer()` converted to `async` to support `await app.register(cors)`:

- Startup: `runningServer = await buildServer()` so shutdown handler can reference the live instance
- Signal handlers use `void shutdown(signal)` to satisfy no-floating-promises lint rule

---

# 39. Next.js Frontend (`web/`)

Full Next.js 15 App Router frontend with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.

**Route groups:**
- `(auth)` — login and register pages
- `(main)` — forum pages

**Pages:**
- `/` — landing/home
- `/login`, `/register` — auth forms (client components)
- `/forum` — paginated post list (server component, SSR)
- `/forum/new` — new post form
- `/forum/[postId]` — post detail + replies (server component)
- `/forum/[postId]/edit` — edit post form

---

# 40. Next.js BFF API Routes

All routes live in `web/src/app/api/` and proxy to Fastify, extracting the JWT from the `token` httpOnly cookie and forwarding it as `Authorization: Bearer`:

```
POST   /api/auth/login                              — sets httpOnly cookie with JWT
POST   /api/auth/register                           — sets httpOnly cookie
POST   /api/auth/logout                             — clears cookie
GET    /api/posts                                   — list posts
POST   /api/posts                                   — create post
GET    /api/posts/[postId]                          — get post
PUT    /api/posts/[postId]                          — update post
DELETE /api/posts/[postId]                          — delete post
GET    /api/posts/[postId]/replies                  — list replies
POST   /api/posts/[postId]/replies                  — create reply
DELETE /api/posts/[postId]/replies/[replyId]        — delete reply
```

---

# 41. Auth Layer (web)

- `web/src/stores/auth.store.ts` — Zustand store: `{ user, setUser, clearUser }`
- `web/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` — client component, POSTs to `/api/auth/login`, updates store
- `web/src/components/auth/RegisterForm.tsx` — same pattern for register
- `web/src/app/(auth)/layout.tsx` — centered card layout for auth pages

---

# 42. Forum Components (web)

**Server-side data fetching:**
- `web/src/services/post.service.ts` — `getPosts(page)`, `getPost(id)` using server-side `ApiClient` with cookie token
- `web/src/components/forum/PostList.tsx` — renders list of `PostCard`
- `web/src/components/forum/PostCard.tsx` — card with title, date, excerpt
- `web/src/components/forum/PostDetail.tsx` — full post with reply section
- `web/src/components/forum/PostForm.tsx` — create/edit form (client component)
- `web/src/components/forum/OwnerActions.tsx` — edit/delete buttons shown only to the post owner

**Reply handling:**
- `web/src/hooks/useReplies.ts` — React Query hook for fetching, creating, and deleting replies
- `web/src/components/forum/ReplySection.tsx` — container: list + form
- `web/src/components/forum/ReplyList.tsx` — skeleton loading + reply items
- `web/src/components/forum/ReplyItem.tsx` — individual reply with delete action for owner
- `web/src/components/forum/ReplyForm.tsx` — textarea + submit

---

# 43. Shared UI Components (web)

`web/src/components/ui/`: `Button`, `Input`, `Textarea`, `Avatar`

`web/src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx` — top nav with forum link and auth state (login/logout)

---

# 44. Shared Package ApiClient Fixes

`packages/shared/src/lib/api.ts` corrected two methods to match actual Fastify response shapes:

- `getPosts`: query param `pageSize` → `limit`; response now unwrapped from `{ posts, total, page, limit }` into `PaginatedResponse<PostResponse>`
- `getReplies`: response was `ReplyResponse[]` → now unwrapped from `{ replies, total, page, limit }`

---

# 45. Reply Threading

`server/prisma/schema.prisma` — `Reply` model updated with self-referential relation:

- `parentReplyId?: String?` — optional FK to another reply in the same post
- Prisma relation name `"ReplyToReply"`: a reply has one optional parent and many children
- Indices added on `parentReplyId` and `createdAt` for efficient tree and chronological queries

`server/src/services/replies.service.ts`:

- `createReply(postId, userId, content, parentReplyId?)` — validates parent reply belongs to same post before inserting; queues `replyIngest` job
- `listReplies(postId, page, limit)` — paginated, ordered by `createdAt` ascending, returns `{ replies, total }`
- `deleteReply(replyId, requestingUserId)` — ownership check; throws `"FORBIDDEN"` on mismatch; queues deletion job

`server/src/api/dtos/replies.dto.ts`:

- `CreateReplyDTO`: validates `content` (non-empty string) and optional `parentReplyId` (UUID)
- `ReplyResponse` interface: `{ id, postId, userId, parentReplyId?, content, createdAt }`

# 46. Type-Weighted Ranking

`server/src/ai/retrieval/ranking/result.ranker.ts` refined the scoring formula:

- `SOURCE_WEIGHT`: `medical: 1.1`, `community: 1.0`
- `TYPE_WEIGHT`: `post: 0.85`, `reply: 0.90` — community only; replies rank slightly higher than posts, reflecting conversational real-world relevance
- Recency decay (`Math.max(0.5, 1 - ageDays / 365)`) applied only to community chunks over a 1-year horizon
- Final score: `chunk.score × sourceWeight × typeWeight × recency`
- Deduplication key: `chunk.replyId ?? chunk.sourceId`

# 47. Citation & Type Enrichment

`packages/shared/src/types/api.ts`:

- `Citation` now carries: `type?: "post" | "reply"`, `snippet?` (first 120 chars of content), `parentPostId?` (reply citations only — links back to the parent post)
- `ReplyResponse` type added with `parentReplyId?` field for threaded replies

`packages/shared/src/lib/api.ts`:

- `getReplies(postId)` — fetches and unwraps `{ replies, total, page, limit }` into array
- `createReply(postId, content, parentReplyId?)` — POST with optional nesting support
- `deleteReply(postId, replyId)` — DELETE with ownership enforced server-side
